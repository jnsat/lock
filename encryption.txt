The CBC, CFB, and OFB modes require an initialization vector as input, in addition to the 
plaintext.  An IV must be generated for each execution of the encryption operation, and the same 
IV is necessary for the corresponding execution of the decryption operation. Therefore, the IV, or 
information that is sufficient to calculate the IV, must be available to each party to the 
communication.
